#Project Overview:
A multi-threaded file server and logging application that allows a client application to 
download files using a set of options.

#Requirements:
The client application should present a command-line user interface when started from
a terminal window as follows: java -cp .:./oop.jar ie.gmit.sw.Client, where oop.jar is
the name of the JAR archive containing the full set of classes (client and server) for the
project. The following options should be offered to a user:

1. Connect to Server
2. Print File Listing
3. Download File
4. Quit
Type Option [1-4]>

#Problems:
I had a problem in finding out how to download the files and if I had more time I would
have started again and made that a top priority in finding out how to achieve this.
I also had a problem with using the terminal window to run the application, so I had
to run it using Eclipse.

#How to run application:
To run the application in Eclipse, you have to start the server.java file, then you can start as
many clients as you want using the client.java file, which will give you the options
1. Connect to Server
2. Print File Listing
3. Download File
4. Quit.
